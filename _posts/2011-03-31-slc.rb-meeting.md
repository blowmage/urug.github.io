Tonights meeting was great. [Jeremy](http://github.com/jisraelsen) gave a demo of BDD using [Rspec](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec)

An old friend, [Jamis](https://github.com/jamis), stopped by to lead a discussion about "Knowing your Tools."

The meeting was streamed by our friends at [Mustache Power](http://mustachepower.com/blog/). The video is now posted at at [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/jakemallory/urug-slc-20110331)
