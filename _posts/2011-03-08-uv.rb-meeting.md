We had a great meeting tonight. [Mike](http://github.com/blowmage) showed [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and how we are using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to host the [new URUG site](http://utruby.org/).

[Tad](http://github.com/phaedryx) gave a terrific presentation on [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). His presentation materials are found [here](http://github.com/phaedryx/coffeescript-presentation).

Next month [Justin](http://github.com/jshakespear) will show [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and [Dave](http://github.com/dbrady) will show various approaches for remote pairing.
