We had another great meeting tonight. [Justin](http://github.com/jshakespear) showed the [ghost](https://github.com/bjeanes/ghost) gem and how easy it is to manage hostname. [Brandon](http://github.com/tehviking) gave us some tips on migrating a Rails 2 app to Rails 3. And [Tad](http://github.com/phaedryx) showed us Smurfs on Rails and how to design modular web applications using Engines. The monolithic Rails app is an anti-pattern and Engines are a great way to implement a modular design.

We had a really good discussion afterwards as well. You should totally come to the June meeting. We don't know what the topics will be, but you can rest assured they will be fascinating.
